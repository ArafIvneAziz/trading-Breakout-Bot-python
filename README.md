# Breakout Bot Readme

This is a readme for a Python script that automates trading for the cryptocurrency pair BTCUSDT on Binance. This script uses the Binance API to track the current price of the pair, and then checks if it has broken out above or below a given resistance/support level. If it is above the resistance level, the script will buy the pair at the current market price. If it is below the support level, the script will sell the pair at the current market price. This script will run every minute.

To use this script, you will need to set your API keys, the symbol you are trading, and the resistance/support levels. You will also need to initialize the Binance client. 

This script is intended for educational and informational purposes only, and is not intended to be used as a trading tool. Please use it at your own risk.
